# Watchtower Canonical Spec v1

## Definition
Watchtower is a deterministic device custody and attestation instrument that observes, measures, and cryptographically
records every device that crosses into the system boundary. Watchtower does not manage or control devices; it
establishes verifiable truth about them.

## Hard Boundary

### Watchtower owns
- Device identity & enrollment
- Device registry (fleet inventory: metadata, not payload imaging)
- Observation snapshots (metadata sets)
- Attestation collection & verification results (platform / TRIAD / wrappers)
- Custody ledger + transcripts (append-only, hash-chained)
- Policy distribution as constraints (policy authored/decided elsewhere)

### Watchtower does NOT own
- Scheduling jobs (Atlas Artifact)
- Capture/restore/verify/attest/seal/transcript of artifacts (TRIAD)
- Repair logic (Legacy Doctor)
- Archive library behavior (Archive Recall)
- Governance decisions (Covenant Gate)

## Identity Model

### Identifiers
- device_id: Watchtower-issued stable UUID (recommended UUIDv7)
- identity_hash: sha256(canonical_json(DeviceIdentityV1))

device_id is permanent. identity_hash may change; changes are recorded as events.

### Identity Tiers
- Tier0 (dev): file key allowed; identity_class=user-asserted
- Tier1: OS keystore key required; identity_class=os-rooted
- Tier2: TPM key + quote evidence; identity_class=hardware-rooted

## Enrollment Ceremony
1) Device generates device key (tier-specific) and creates JoinRequest.
2) Device obtains pairing token (time-bounded).
3) Admin approves JoinRequest, Watchtower issues EnrollmentReceipt.
4) Watchtower assigns device_id and publishes initial policy constraints bundle reference.
5) Device becomes ENROLLED; posture computed by constraints + evidence.

Offline enrollment is supported via signed outbox/inbox packets.

## Observations
Watchtower records ObservationSets: normalized, policy-scoped metadata snapshots.
Watchtower never records secrets. Redaction is not a feature; instead, collection is policy-gated.

## Attestations
Watchtower accepts:
- Platform attestation (device → Watchtower): signed ObservationSet; optional TPM quote bundle.
- TRIAD attestation (TRIAD → Watchtower): run receipt with ArtifactId + roots + transcript_root + hashes.
- Wrapper receipts (Atlas/Legacy Doctor/Security instruments): signed run summaries with artifact hash references.

Watchtower verifies signatures + required fields; it does not re-prove TRIAD semantics.

## Ledger & Transcript
- Append-only NDJSON events.
- Each event includes prev_hash and hash.
- Daily checkpoint seals (configurable) create a SealEvent referencing transcript_head hash and checkpoint signature.

## Receipts & Artifacts
Watchtower emits Receipt Artifact v1 (manifest + sha256sums + optional transcript slice + detached signature).

## Policy Interaction (Covenant Gate)
- Gate is policy source of truth.
- Watchtower consumes signed PolicyBundle.
- Watchtower enforces constraints only: minimum attestation grades, quarantine thresholds, allowed operations.
- Overlays can only add walls; never weaken baseline.

## Posture / Zones
Posture is a computed label recorded in events:
unknown → observed → enrolled → verified → high_assurance
Failures → quarantined
Decommission → retired

Upgrade/downgrade triggers are policy-driven.
Watchtower records results; it does not invent policy.

# Canonical JSON Rules v1 (Watchtower)

All hashes and signatures rely on canonical serialization.

- UTF-8 encoding without BOM
- LF newlines when writing JSON files
- Object keys sorted lexicographically
- Arrays preserve order as authored by schema rules
- No insignificant whitespace (minified form recommended for hashing)
- Timestamps are data fields; never used as implicit ordering keys
- All hashes are sha256 over exact bytes of canonical JSON

# Watchtower Ledger v1

## Storage
Primary transcript format: NDJSON.
Each line is a canonical JSON object conforming to ledger_event_v1.

## Hash Chain
hash = sha256(canonical_json(event_without_hash) || "\n")
prev_hash points to the prior event hash (or GENESIS for first event).

## Checkpoint Seal
Once per day (configurable), Watchtower emits event type:
- ledger.checkpoint.seal
Payload includes:
- transcript_head_hash
- checkpoint_range (start/end event_id)
- signature by Watchtower authority key

# Watchtower Receipt Artifact v1

A Watchtower receipt is a deterministic evidence packet consumable by other instruments.

  signatures/
    receipt.ed25519.sig
  payload/

## IDs
receipt_id = sha256(canonical_json(payload/receipt.json))

## Signing
- receipt.ed25519.sig is detached signature over receipt_id (or over receipt.json bytes; choose one and lock).
Canonical rule: sign receipt_id (hex) + "\n" as UTF-8 bytes.

## receipt.json fields
- schema_version
- tenant_id
- receipt_id
- kind (enrollment|attestation_ingest|policy_apply|triad_run_ingest|checkpoint_seal|export)
- device_id (optional depending on kind)
- refs: list of {type, sha256, media_type}
- policy_ref (if relevant)

# Device Posture / Zones v1

Posture is a computed label recorded in ledger events.

- unknown: device seen, no trusted identity
- observed: device has identity packet but not approved
- enrolled: admin approved, device_id assigned
- verified: meets policy min attestation grade + recent heartbeat
- high_assurance: TPM-backed + secure boot evidence + policy-required cadence satisfied
- quarantined: failed checks or revoked
- retired: decommissioned; no longer valid

Upgrade/downgrade triggers are policy-driven.

Roles:
- Owner
- OrgAdmin
- DeviceAdmin
- Operator
- Auditor
- DeviceAgent (machine principal)

Must-have boundaries:
1) Enrollment / revocation is OrgAdmin+ only (Owner implicit).
2) Operator can request actions (create RunRequests) but cannot approve enroll/revoke.
3) Auditor is read-only; access to raw identifiers is policy-gated (prefer hashed facts).
4) DeviceAgent can write only:
   - its own ObservationSets
   - its own platform attestations
   It cannot read fleet or policies beyond what it is issued.
5) Policy bundles can be installed only by OrgAdmin (or by verified Gate channel).
